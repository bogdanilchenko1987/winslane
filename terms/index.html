                If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or
                invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to
                accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest
                extent possible under applicable law and the remaining
                provisions will continue in full force and effect.

                Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to

                affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
                performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a
                breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
